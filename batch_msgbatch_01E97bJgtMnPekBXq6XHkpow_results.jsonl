High-level overview (\u2264120 words)\n\nTopic 6 captures a homeostatic endothelial state centered on three interrelated processes: negative regulation of Wnt signaling (Nkd1, Znrf3), iron metabolism and ferroptosis defense (Tfrc, Fth1, Slc7a1), and vascular-specific signaling functions (Aplnr, Best1, Flrt2). The program is enriched in amino acid and ion transporters (Slc7a1, Slc1a4, Slc44a5, Slc35f2) alongside extracellular matrix and adhesion regulators (Chn2, Flrt2). Regulatory analysis reveals antagonistic control by Wnt/TGF-\u03b2 pathway activators (Fzd4, Tgfbr1/2) versus integrin and GATA2-mediated repression, suggesting this program defines a quiescent capillary phenotype maintained through balanced pathway activity. The cell-type enrichment in homeostatic capillary endothelium directly aligns with the gene expression signature of iron handling, barrier function, and canonical pathway modulation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Functional modules and mechanisms\n\n### Module 1: Wnt pathway negative regulation\n**Key genes:** Nkd1, Znrf3, Bambi, Tle4, Tle1, Notum  \n**Proposed mechanism:** This module actively restrains Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling through multiple mechanisms: Nkd1 antagonizes Dishevelled, Znrf3 ubiquitinates frizzled receptors for degradation, and Tle proteins suppress TCF/LEF transcriptional activity. The concurrent expression of these negative regulators with weak activation by Fzd4 suggests this program maintains endothelial quiescence by preventing excessive Wnt activation that would drive proliferation or arterial specification.\n\n### Module 2: Ferroptosis defense and iron metabolism\n**Key genes:** Tfrc, Fth1, Slc7a1, Slc40a1, Acsl1, Slc3a2  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Tfrc (transferrin receptor) imports iron while Fth1 (ferritin heavy chain) sequesters it in non-toxic form, preventing iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. Slc7a1 transports L-arginine for nitric oxide synthesis and may support antioxidant systems. Evidence links Fth1 degradation to vascular endothelial ferroptosis (PMID:38657941, PMID:38521431), and Tfrc modulation affects endothelial ferroptosis susceptibility (PMID:41261650, PMID:40582717), positioning this module as critical for capillary survival under oxidative stress.\n\n### Module 3: Vascular-specific signaling and barrier function\n**Key genes:** Aplnr, Best1, Flrt2, Chn2, Nectin2, Tjp1  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Aplnr (apelin receptor) mediates vasodilatory and angiogenic signals in capillaries and is a microvascular EC marker (PMID:39226154). Best1 forms calcium-activated chloride/bicarbonate channels that may regulate endothelial volume or pH homeostasis. Flrt2 functions in cell adhesion and its downregulation associates with EC detachment resistance (PMID:38972570), suggesting this module coordinates vascular tone, barrier integrity, and cell-matrix attachment in stable capillaries.\n\n### Module 4: Amino acid and metabolite transport\n**Key genes:** Slc7a1, Slc1a4, Slc44a5, Slc35f2, Nampt  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Multiple solute carriers handle amino acids (Slc7a1 for cationic amino acids, Slc1a4 for neutral amino acids including serine/alanine) and choline (Slc44a5). Nampt catalyzes NAD+ biosynthesis, a metabolic checkpoint for cellular stress responses and aging. Slc7a1 may also transport proteins across the blood-brain barrier (PMID:38547677). This metabolic signature suggests capillary ECs maintain distinct nutrient handling capacities to support tissue-specific homeostasis.\n\n### Module 5: Synaptic organization and neural interaction\n**Key genes:** Flrt2, Mdga2, Cbln2, Btbd11, Ndnf  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Unexpected enrichment of synaptic regulators (Flrt2, Mdga2, Cbln2) in endothelial cells may reflect brain EC specialization for neurovascular coupling. Flrt2 mediates repulsive guidance through UNC5 receptors during neural development, Cbln2 regulates glutamatergic synapse assembly, and Ndnf localizes to extracellular space with roles in nitric oxide signaling (cellular response to hypoxia). This module may coordinate vascular-neural communication in brain capillaries, though the mechanistic basis for synaptic gene expression in ECs requires further investigation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Distinctive features\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Topic 6 is the co-expression of ferroptosis defense machinery (Tfrc, Fth1, Slc7a1) with active Wnt pathway suppression (Nkd1, Znrf3), suggesting capillary ECs balance oxidative stress resilience against proliferative pathway activation. The unique genes include Abhd2 (endocannabinoid lipase regulating membrane signaling), Ndnf (hypoxia-responsive extracellular protein), and Mir100hg (lncRNA regulating cell proliferation), further emphasizing metabolic and signaling restraint. The presence of synaptic organizers (Cbln2, Mdga2) and specialized channels (Best1) in unique genes points to brain capillary-specific adaptations, though the functional integration of these neural-associated genes in endothelial biology remains incompletely understood from this evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Regulator analysis\n\n### Fzd4 (activator, log2FC=-0.511): [Confidence: High]\n**Mechanistic hypothesis:** Fzd4 knockdown suppresses Topic 6, yet the program enriches Wnt pathway *negative* regulators (Nkd1, Znrf3, Notum). This apparent paradox suggests Fzd4 may activate non-canonical Wnt signaling (supported by Wnt5a interaction) that induces compensatory negative feedback machinery to restrain canonical \u03b2-catenin signaling. Fzd4 is essential for CNS angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier formation; its control of this homeostatic capillary program likely maintains the balance between barrier maturation signals and proliferative suppression. The STRING interactions with Znrf3 (943) and Bambi (924), both present in Topic 6, suggest Fzd4 directly coordinates expression of its own negative regulators.\n\n### Tgfbr2/Tgfbr1 (activators, log2FC=-0.484/-0.379): [Confidence: High]\n**Mechanistic hypothesis:** TGF-\u03b2 receptor signaling through SMAD3 activates Topic 6, consistent with TGF-\u03b2's role in promoting endothelial quiescence and barrier maturation. The receptors interact with Bambi (inhibitory pseudoreceptor present in Topic 6) and may induce adherens junction components (Tjp1, Nectin2). Evidence shows TGF-\u03b2/TFRC pathway interactions regulate endothelial ferroptosis (PMID:40582717), directly linking Tgfbr activity to the ferroptosis defense module. TGF-\u03b2 signaling likely maintains the homeostatic capillary phenotype by coordinating barrier function, suppressing proliferation, and inducing iron handling machinery.\n\n### Gata2 (repressor, log2FC=+0.190): [Confidence: Medium]\n**Mechanistic hypothesis:** Gata2 knockdown increases Topic 6 activity, suggesting Gata2 normally suppresses this homeostatic program to maintain endothelial plasticity or tip cell potential. Gata2 is essential for hematoendothelial specification and angiogenic activation; its repression of ferroptosis defense genes (Tfrc interaction score 463) and metabolic quiescence markers may prevent premature capillary stabilization. The balance between Gata2 (promoting angiogenic competence) and Topic 6 (promoting homeostatic quiescence) likely controls the transition from active angiogenesis to mature capillary stabilization in brain vasculature.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

High-level overview (\u2264120 words)\n\nTopic 11 is characterized by angiogenic signaling molecules (Angpt2, Cxcr4) and vascular regulators (Tnfrsf11b, Hopx) that coordinate endothelial activation. The program integrates metabolic transport functions through amino acid and monocarboxylate transporters (Slc1a1, Slc16a9, Slc16a4) with ion channel activity mediating calcium and potassium flux (Cacna1c, Kcnj2, Kcnq1). Small GTPase regulatory machinery (Rhod, Cdc42ep3, Dgki, multiple Rho-GAPs and GEFs) suggests active cytoskeletal remodeling and membrane dynamics. The presence of secretory pathway components (Cpe, Gabarapl1, Sort1) alongside lipid metabolism enzymes (Acsl3, Dgki) indicates coordinated membrane trafficking and signaling. Cell-type enrichment shows moderate angiogenic tip cell signature, consistent with Angpt2 expression and dynamic vascular state.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Functional modules and mechanisms\n\n**Module 1: Angiogenic signaling and vascular remodeling**\n- **Key genes:** Angpt2, Cxcr4, Tnfrsf11b, Nrp1, Flt4, Kdr, Efnb3, Hbegf\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Angpt2 mediates vascular destabilization and angiogenic activation through Tek receptor antagonism, while Cxcr4 promotes endothelial cell migration and positioning. Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin) functions as a secreted decoy receptor regulating both bone resorption and vascular calcification. The coordinated expression with receptor tyrosine kinases (Flt4, Kdr) and guidance molecules (Nrp1, Efnb3) suggests active tip cell-like behavior during vessel sprouting or remodeling.\n\n**Module 2: Ion channel and membrane excitability**\n- **Key genes:** Kcnj2, Cacna1c, Kcnq1, Chp2\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Kcnj2 encodes an inward-rectifying potassium channel establishing membrane potential and vascular tone, while Cacna1c mediates voltage-dependent calcium influx critical for excitation-contraction coupling and signaling. Chp2 regulates pH homeostasis through Na+/H+ exchange and can modulate calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathways. This ion channel machinery likely coordinates endothelial electrical responses with calcium-dependent transcriptional programs during angiogenic activation.\n\n**Module 3: Metabolic transport and barrier function**\n- **Key genes:** Slc1a1, Slc16a9, Slc16a4, Slc7a5, Slc38a2, Mfsd2a, Slco2b1, Slc1a4\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Slc1a1 mediates high-affinity glutamate/aspartate transport and has been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis through cellular and mitochondrial influx of oncometabolites in IDH1-mutant contexts (PMID:35459936). The monocarboxylate transporters (Slc16a9, Slc16a4) and amino acid transporters (Slc7a5, Slc38a2) coordinate metabolic substrate delivery. Mfsd2a, a critical blood-brain barrier lipid transporter, suggests specialized barrier functions. This transport network likely sustains the high metabolic demands of angiogenic endothelial cells.\n\n**Module 4: Small GTPase regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics**\n- **Key genes:** Rhod, Cdc42ep3, Dgki, Arhgap18, Arhgef3, Stard13, Kank1, Tiam1, Dock2, Dock4\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Rhod coordinates endosome dynamics with actin cytoskeleton reorganization, while Cdc42ep3 acts as an effector of CDC42 controlling pseudopodia formation and cell shape changes. Dgki regulates diacylglycerol/phosphatidic acid balance, modulating small GTPase signaling. The abundance of RhoGAPs (Arhgap18, Stard13) and RhoGEFs (Arhgef3, Tiam1, Dock2, Dock4) indicates tight spatiotemporal control of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 activities during active migration and membrane remodeling.\n\n**Module 5: Secretory pathway and protein trafficking**\n- **Key genes:** Cpe, Sort1, Gabarapl1, Syt12, Bag2, Chst9\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Cpe processes prohormones and peptide neurotransmitters and functions as a sorting receptor for regulated secretory pathway proteins, potentially coordinating endothelial-derived signaling molecule release. Sort1 directs protein trafficking to lysosomes, endosomes, or cell surface. Gabarapl1 mediates autophagosome formation and cellular responses to stress. Syt12 modulates calcium-independent vesicle exocytosis. This secretory machinery likely coordinates the release of angiogenic factors (including Angpt2) and maintains protein homeostasis during active endothelial remodeling.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Distinctive features\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Topic 11 is the integration of angiogenic signaling (Angpt2, Cxcr4) with extensive ion channel machinery (Kcnj2, Cacna1c, Kcnq1) not typically emphasized in standard angiogenic programs. The unique genes include Jph1 (junctional complex protein linking plasma membrane to ER/SR, coordinating membrane and intracellular calcium channels), Sort1 (vesicular trafficking regulator with cardiovascular disease associations), and Acsl3 (long-chain fatty acid metabolism enzyme preferentially utilizing arachidonate). This combination suggests a specialized endothelial state coupling electrical/calcium signaling with metabolic adaptation and membrane remodeling, potentially reflecting brain endothelial-specific properties where neuronal-like ion channel activity intersects with vascular functions.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Regulator analysis\n\n**Eng (Activator, log2FC=-0.669):** [Confidence: High]\nEndoglin is a TGF-\u03b2 co-receptor whose knockdown reduces program activity, strongly connecting to multiple program genes including Kdr, Angpt2, Cxcr4, Flt4, and Sox9 (STRING interactions). Mechanistically, Eng likely promotes the angiogenic signaling module by enhancing TGF-\u03b2/ALK1 signaling that drives endothelial activation and tip cell specification. The coordinated downregulation of Angpt2 and Cxcr4 upon Eng knockdown suggests Eng maintains the angiogenic state. The connection to Sox9, a transcription factor regulating endothelial identity, indicates Eng may control transcriptional programs governing the ion channel (Kcnj2, Cacna1c) and transport (Slc family) genes characteristic of this program.\n\n**Tgfbr1 (Activator, log2FC=-0.537):** [Confidence: High]\nTGF-\u03b2 receptor type 1 (ALK5) knockdown reduces program activity and shows strong interactions with Eng, Ccn2, Cxcr4, and Sox9. Mechanistically, Tgfbr1 likely drives this program through canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling that coordinates endothelial differentiation and angiogenic responses. The interaction with Eng suggests cooperative TGF-\u03b2/ALK1 and TGF-\u03b2/ALK5 signaling balance. Tgfbr1 may regulate the secretory machinery (Cpe, Sort1) through transcriptional control and maintain the metabolic transport phenotype by sustaining endothelial barrier specialization genes. The presence of Prdm1 (BLIMP1, a TGF-\u03b2-responsive transcriptional repressor) in top-loading genes supports TGF-\u03b2 pathway centrality.\n\n**Tek (Repressor, log2FC=+0.234):** [Confidence: High]\nTek (Tie2) knockdown increases program activity, with extensive interactions to Angpt2, Eng, Kdr, Cxcr4, Vwf, and Dll4. Mechanistically, Tek normally transduces Angpt1-mediated vascular stabilization signals, opposing the destabilizing effects of Angpt2. The strong Angpt2-Tek interaction (STRING score 999) suggests this program represents an Angpt2-high, destabilized state that Tek normally suppresses. When Tek is knocked down, loss of stabilizing signals allows increased expression of the angiogenic activation program. This explains the apparent paradox: Tek acts as a brake on the Angpt2-driven angiogenic/remodeling state captured in Topic 11. The repressor role suggests this program activates when Angpt2/Angpt1 ratio favors destabilization.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

The program includes negative feedback regulators (Smad7, Mxi1) and metabolic transporters (Slc16a1, Slc46a3, Bsg), suggesting active metabolic reprogramming under oxygen-limiting conditions. Endothelial-specific angiogenic modulators appear alongside cytoskeletal regulators (Tiam1, Arhgap29, Sparcl1) and vascular-relevant factors (Nostrin, Depp1). The enrichment in angiogenic tip, BBB-high, and homeostatic capillaries is consistent with metabolic adaptation during vessel remodeling and barrier function maintenance. The convergence of glycolysis, hypoxia response, and vascular morphogenesis genes (Hdac9, Ifnar1, Fndc1) suggests metabolic-structural coupling during endothelial state transitions.\n\n## Functional modules and mechanisms\n\n**Module 1: Glycolytic metabolic core**\nKey genes: Ldha, Pkm, Tpi1, Slc16a1, Bsg\n\nProposed mechanism: This module represents the enzymatic machinery for anaerobic glycolysis, with Ldha converting pyruvate to lactate, Pkm catalyzing the final ATP-generating step, and Tpi1 isomerizing glycolytic intermediates. Slc16a1 exports lactate while Bsg (basigin/CD147) facilitates monocarboxylate transport, creating a coordinated system for lactate production and clearance during hypoxic conditions.\n\n**Module 2: Hypoxia-responsive mitochondrial adaptation**\nKey genes: Bnip3, Depp1, Fndc1, Adm\n\nProposed mechanism: Bnip3 is a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein induced under hypoxia that mediates mitophagy, while Fndc1 localizes to mitochondrial membranes and responds to hypoxia. Depp1 contains SNARE domains and targets peroxisomes, potentially coordinating organellar responses. Adm (adrenomedullin) provides vasodilatory and pro-angiogenic signaling, linking metabolic stress to vascular adaptation (PMID:40190807 shows ADM reduces inflammation in endothelial cells under stress).\n\n**Module 3: Transcriptional feedback and metabolic regulation**\nKey genes: Hdac9, Mxi1, Smad7, Ifnar1\n\nProposed mechanism: This module contains transcriptional regulators that may fine-tune the hypoxic-glycolytic response. Hdac9 modulates chromatin accessibility and inflammatory pathways in endothelial cells (PMID:34935488 demonstrates HDAC9 mediates inflammatory injury via P38 MAPK). Mxi1 antagonizes MYC activity, potentially limiting proliferative metabolism. Smad7 provides negative feedback on TGF-\u03b2 signaling (PMID:38657333 shows SMAD7 regulation affects endothelial injury), while Ifnar1 links interferon responses to metabolic adaptation.\n\n**Module 4: Cytoskeletal and vascular morphogenesis**\nKey genes: Tiam1, Arhgap29, Sparcl1, Nostrin, Phactr4\n\nProposed mechanism: Tiam1 activates RAC1 to regulate actin dynamics, cell migration, and polarity, while Arhgap29 modulates Rho GTPase signaling downstream of Rap1. Sparcl1 is an extracellular matrix protein dramatically upregulated in lung capillary ECs during injury (PMID:37292817), promoting inflammatory responses. Nostrin regulates eNOS localization and attenuates NO production, potentially modulating vascular tone during metabolic stress. Phactr4 interacts with actin and PP1 phosphatase, linking signaling to cytoskeletal remodeling.\n\n**Module 5: Metabolic transport and lysosomal function**\nKey genes: Slc46a3, Car5a, Sntb2, Samd9l\n\nProposed mechanism: Slc46a3 is a lysosomal transporter that moves catabolites from lysosomes to cytoplasm, potentially clearing metabolic byproducts during hypoxic stress. Car5a (carbonic anhydrase) regulates pH homeostasis critical for glycolytic metabolism. Sntb2 associates with dystrophin complexes at membranes, while Samd9l acts in innate immunity and cell proliferation, potentially linking metabolic adaptation to stress surveillance.\n\n## Distinctive features\n\nThe most distinctive feature is the coupling of core glycolytic machinery (Ldha, Pkm, Tpi1, Slc16a1) with hypoxia-responsive mitochondrial regulators (Bnip3, Fndc1) and endothelial-specific negative feedback systems (Nostrin for eNOS, Smad7 for TGF-\u03b2, Mxi1 for MYC). The presence of Ankrd37 (cytosolic/mitochondrial/nuclear localization) and the interferon receptor Ifnar1 alongside metabolic genes suggests coordination between metabolic reprogramming and immune/inflammatory signaling. The unique gene Vstm2b and the lysosomal transporter Slc46a3 further distinguish this from generic hypoxia programs, indicating specialized endothelial metabolic-lysosomal coupling.\n\n## Regulator analysis\n\n**Arnt (activator, log2FC=-0.554):** [Confidence: High]\nMechanistic hypothesis: Arnt (HIF-1\u03b2) heterodimerizes with HIF-1\u03b1 to form the active HIF-1 transcription factor complex, directly driving expression of program genes Hif1a, Ldha, Pkm, and Bnip3 (all showing STRING scores >490). This establishes the master transcriptional control of the glycolytic-hypoxic response, with knockdown disrupting the entire metabolic adaptation cascade including lactate production (Ldha), pyruvate metabolism (Pkm), and mitochondrial autophagy (Bnip3).\n\n**Egln2 (repressor, log2FC=+0.264):** [Confidence: High]\nMechanistic hypothesis: Egln2 (PHD1) hydroxylates HIF-1\u03b1 under normoxia, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Knockdown stabilizes HIF-1\u03b1 (STRING=995), driving increased expression of downstream targets Ldha, Pkm, Bnip3, and P4ha1. This creates a double-negative regulatory circuit where Egln2 loss mimics hypoxia, activating the same glycolytic-mitochondrial program that defines Topic 18.\n\n**Tgfbr2 (repressor, log2FC=+0.143):** [Confidence: Medium]\nMechanistic hypothesis: Tgfbr2 knockdown increases program activity, likely through relieving repression of Smad7 (STRING=981), which itself provides negative feedback on TGF-\u03b2 signaling. The interaction with Eng (endoglin, STRING=975) and connections to Hif1a (STRING=601) suggest crosstalk between TGF-\u03b2 and hypoxia pathways. Loss of Tgfbr2 may shift endothelial cells toward a pro-glycolytic, pro-angiogenic state by reducing growth-suppressive TGF-\u03b2 signaling while permitting HIF-1-driven metabolic reprogramming.\n\n## Program stats\n\n- **Top-loading genes:** Ankrd37, Ldha, Ttyh2, Pkm, Sntb2, Arhgap29, Sparcl1, Tiam1, Depp1, Hdac9, Smad7, Bsg, Nostrin, Samd9l, Phactr4, Bnip3, Mxi1, Fndc1, Ifnar1, Rassf4\n\n- **Unique genes:** Slc46a3, Gm15283, Tpi1, Vstm2b, Adm, Kif2a, Myl4, Car5a, Slc16a1, Tmeff1\n\n- **Cell-type enrichment:** Weakly enriched in angiogenic tip cells, BBB-high capillary, and homeostatic capillary endothelial cells, consistent with metabolic adaptation during active angiogenesis and barrier maintenance.", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5655, "output_tokens": 2153, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
