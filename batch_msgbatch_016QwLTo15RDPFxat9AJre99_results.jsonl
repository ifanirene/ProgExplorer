The iron-ferroptosis axis is evident through transferrin receptor (Tfrc), ferritin heavy chain (Fth1), and cationic amino acid transporter (Slc7a1). Aplnr, a key endothelial G-protein coupled receptor, suggests microvascular endothelial identity. Additional metabolic regulators include Nampt (NAD+ biosynthesis) and multiple solute carriers (Slc1a4, Slc44a5, Slc35f2). The Wnt pathway shows negative regulatory enrichment (Nkd1, Znrf3, Notum). The program integrates metabolic stress responses with barrier integrity and signaling pathway modulation in brain endothelial cells.\n\n## Functional modules and mechanisms\n\n**Module 1: Iron metabolism and ferroptosis regulation**  \n**Key genes:** Tfrc, Fth1, Slc7a1, Slc40a1, Slc3a2, Acsl1, Slc39a8  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Tfrc mediates cellular iron uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis (literature evidence: regulated during ferroptosis), while Fth1 stores iron in non-toxic form (literature evidence: degradation promotes ferroptosis). Slc7a1 transports cationic amino acids including arginine at the blood-brain barrier, potentially supporting nitric oxide synthesis and antioxidant defense. The coordinated expression suggests active management of iron homeostasis to prevent or modulate ferroptotic cell death in brain endothelial cells.\n\n**Module 2: Wnt pathway negative regulation**  \n**Key genes:** Nkd1, Znrf3, Notum, Tle1, Tle4, Vgll4, Tpbg, Nxn  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Nkd1 functions as a Dishevelled-binding protein that negatively regulates Wnt-beta-catenin-Tcf signaling (gene summary evidence). Znrf3 ubiquitinates and promotes degradation of Wnt receptors (frizzled binding activity, gene summary). Notum removes palmitoleate from Wnt proteins. The convergence of multiple negative regulators suggests active suppression of canonical Wnt signaling, potentially to maintain endothelial quiescence or prevent aberrant proliferation.\n\n**Module 3: Endothelial adhesion and barrier function**  \n**Key genes:** Flrt2, Tjp1, Nectin2, Cdh2, Fn1, Actn1, Baiap2  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Flrt2 (fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein) functions in cell adhesion and vascular development, with downregulation associated with EC detachment resistance (PMID:38972570). Tjp1 (ZO-1) and Nectin2 form tight/adherens junction components. Cdh2 (N-cadherin) mediates homophilic adhesion. This module likely maintains blood-brain barrier integrity while allowing dynamic regulation during vascular remodeling or stress responses.\n\n**Module 4: Metabolic control and stress response**  \n**Key genes:** Nampt, Rbp1, Abhd2, Aplnr, Nos3  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Nampt catalyzes NAD+ biosynthesis, critical for cellular metabolism and stress responses (gene summary: involved in metabolism, stress response, aging). Rbp1 transports retinol from storage to peripheral tissues. Aplnr (apelin receptor) is a microvascular EC marker (PMID:39226154) that inhibits adenylate cyclase and regulates cardiovascular function and glucose metabolism. Abhd2 hydrolyzes endocannabinoid arachidonoylglycerol. This module integrates metabolic signaling with vascular-specific functions.\n\n**Module 5: Specialized transport and ion channels**  \n**Key genes:** Lrrc55, Best1, Slc1a4, Slc44a5, Slc35f2, Sidt1  \n**Proposed mechanism:** Lrrc55 is a voltage-gated potassium channel component, while Best1 encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel highly permeable to bicarbonate (gene summary: critical in retinal tissue). Slc1a4 transports neutral amino acids (alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine) in sodium-dependent manner. Slc44a5 mediates choline transport. This diverse transporter set suggests specialized metabolic exchange functions potentially specific to brain microvascular endothelium.\n\n## Distinctive features\n\nThe most distinctive feature is the coordinated expression of ferroptosis-regulatory machinery (Tfrc, Fth1, Slc7a1) alongside multiple Wnt pathway inhibitors (Nkd1, Znrf3, Notum), suggesting a program that simultaneously manages oxidative/iron stress and suppresses proliferative signaling in brain endothelial cells. The presence of specialized transporters and channels (Best1, Lrrc55, multiple SLC family members) alongside microvascular marker Aplnr indicates a brain-specific endothelial phenotype managing unique metabolic demands. The convergence of synapse-associated genes (Flrt2, Cbln2, Mdga2, Btbd11) is notable but their role in endothelium versus contamination/signaling crosstalk remains unclear from the provided evidence.\n\n## Regulator analysis\n\n**No significant regulators identified from Perturb-seq.**\n\nThe absence of identified perturbation-responsive regulators suggests this program may represent a baseline metabolic/homeostatic state rather than an acutely inducible response, or that the key regulators were not included in the perturbation screen. The coordinated expression of ferroptosis genes (Tfrc, Fth1) could be regulated by iron-responsive elements (IREs) and iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), while Wnt inhibitors might respond to mechanical or metabolic cues, but these hypotheses cannot be confirmed from the provided Perturb-seq data.\n\n## Program stats\n\n- **Top-loading genes:** Lrrc55, Nkd1, Rbp1, Slc7a1, Btbd11, Nampt, Aplnr, Fth1, Best1, Chn2, Rbms3, Flrt2, Rp1, Reep1, Pglyrp1, Tfrc, Slc44a5, B4galt5, Mdga2, Slc1a4\n- **Unique genes:** Abhd2, Ndnf, Focad, Mir100hg, Slc35f2, Cbln2, Sidt1, Znrf3, Prex1, Ildr2\n- **Cell-type enrichment:** Not available in provided data; Aplnr presence suggests microvascular endothelial phenotype based on literature evidence (PMID:39226154)", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5158, "output_tokens": 1849, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
{"custom_id": "topic_18_annotation", "result": {"message": {"id": "msg_0183eGUk8p3V1zjpDFthQ6mp", "content": [{"citations": null, "text": "## Program 18 annotation\n\n**Brief Summary:** Topic 18 represents a hypoxia-responsive metabolic reprogramming program in endothelial cells, characterized by glycolytic enzyme upregulation, HIF-1 pathway activation, and coordinated responses to decreased oxygen availability.\n\n**Program label:** Endothelial hypoxia-glycolytic response\n\n---\n\n## 1. High-level overview (\u2264120 words)\n\nThis program captures an endothelial cell state centered on metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. The glycolytic machinery is prominently represented (Ldha, Pkm, Tpi1, Slc16a1, encoding lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, triose phosphate isomerase, and monocarboxylate transporter), indicating active anaerobic glucose metabolism. HIF-1 signaling components and oxygen-sensing machinery are evident (Bnip3, Depp1, Adm, Ifnar1), consistent with cellular response to decreased oxygen. Vascular-specific features include endothelial regulators of NO signaling (Nostrin), extracellular matrix interactions (Sparcl1), and Rho GTPase modulators affecting barrier function (Arhgap29, Tiam1). The transcriptional repressor Mxi1 and histone deacetylase Hdac9 suggest active transcriptional remodeling. Cell-type enrichment data not provided.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Functional modules and mechanisms\n\n**Module 1: Glycolytic metabolism and lactate production**\n- **Key genes:** Ldha, Pkm, Tpi1, Slc16a1, Bsg\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Core glycolytic enzymes (Pkm catalyzes phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate conversion; Tpi1 catalyzes G3P/DHAP isomerization; Ldha converts pyruvate to lactate with NADH oxidation) coordinate anaerobic ATP production. Slc16a1 exports lactate and protons across the plasma membrane, while Bsg (basigin) facilitates monocarboxylate transporter function and promotes tumor progression-associated metabolic remodeling in endothelium.\n\n**Module 2: Hypoxia sensing and HIF-1 pathway activation**\n- **Key genes:** Bnip3, Depp1, Adm, Ifnar1, Nostrin\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Bnip3 functions as a hypoxia-inducible mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factor and mitophagy regulator (PMID:37914354, PMID:38769658). Depp1 expression is induced by metabolic stress and activates transcription factor phosphorylation. Adm (adrenomedullin) provides vasodilatory and angiogenic responses to oxygen deprivation (PMID:40190807), while Nostrin modulates eNOS activity by triggering its translocation from plasma membrane to vesicular structures, attenuating NO production under stress.\n\n**Module 3: Vascular barrier and cytoskeletal regulation**\n- **Key genes:** Arhgap29, Tiam1, Sparcl1, Sntb2, Phactr4\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Arhgap29 mediates Rap1-induced inhibition of Rho signaling at cell-cell junctions, critical for endothelial barrier integrity. Tiam1 functions as RAC1-specific GEF controlling actin cytoskeletal remodeling, cell adhesion, and polarity. Sparcl1 dramatically upregulates in pulmonary capillary ECs upon injury (PMID:37292817), promoting inflammatory macrophage polarization (PMID:38762489). Phactr4 inhibits PP1 phosphatase activity while interacting with actin, coordinating cytoskeletal-signaling integration.\n\n**Module 4: TGF-\u03b2/SMAD and transcriptional regulation**\n- **Key genes:** Smad7, Hdac9, Mxi1, Samd9l\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Smad7 negatively regulates TGF-\u03b2 signaling by recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 to TGFBR1, causing receptor degradation and modulating YAP1 axis to protect against vascular injury (PMID:38657333). Hdac9 mediates ox-LDL-induced inflammatory injury in ECs through P38 MAPK pathway modulation (PMID:34935488). Mxi1 antagonizes MYC transcriptional activity by competing for MAX binding, providing tumor-suppressive potential. This module coordinates chromatin remodeling with stress-responsive transcriptional programs.\n\n**Module 5: Angiogenic signaling and cell adhesion**\n- **Key genes:** Fndc1, Rassf4, Tmeff1, Vstm2b, Kif2a\n- **Proposed mechanism:** Fndc1 localizes to cell-cell junctions and mitochondrial membranes, responding to hypoxia and regulating protein phosphorylation cascades. Rassf4 may provide tumor-suppressive functions. Tmeff1 functions as receptor ligand inhibitor blocking viral entry. Kif2a encodes a plus end-directed motor protein required for spindle dynamics and cell division, suggesting capacity for proliferative responses within this predominantly metabolic program.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Distinctive features\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Program 18 is the tight integration of glycolytic metabolic reprogramming with vascular-specific stress responses. The coordinated expression of three sequential glycolytic enzymes (Tpi1, Pkm, Ldha) alongside the lactate transporter (Slc16a1) represents a complete anaerobic metabolic module rarely observed as a unified program. The unique genes Slc46a3 (lysosomal catabolite transporter), Car5a (carbonic anhydrase), and Myl4 (atrial/embryonic myosin light chain) suggest additional specialized metabolic and contractile adaptations. The presence of both pro-inflammatory mediators (Sparcl1) and anti-inflammatory regulators (Smad7, Nostrin) indicates this is a complex stress-response state balancing protective and potentially pathological endothelial functions.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Regulator analysis\n\nNo significant regulators identified from Perturb-seq.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Program stats\n\n- **Top-loading genes:** Ankrd37, Ldha, Ttyh2, Pkm, Sntb2, Arhgap29, Sparcl1, Tiam1, Depp1, Hdac9, Smad7, Bsg, Nostrin, Samd9l, Phactr4, Bnip3, Mxi1, Fndc1, Ifnar1, Rassf4\n\n- **Unique genes:** Slc46a3, Gm15283, Tpi1, Vstm2b, Adm, Kif2a, Myl4, Car5a, Slc16a1, Tmeff1\n\n- **Cell-type enrichment:** Not available", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5154, "output_tokens": 1723, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
