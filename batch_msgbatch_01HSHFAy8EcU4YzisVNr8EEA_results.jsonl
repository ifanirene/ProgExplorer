Core components include TGF-\u03b2 growth factor responsiveness (Tgfbr2, Smad6, Cav1, Cav2, Ltbp4), non-canonical WNT signaling (Wnt5b, Fzd4), ECM organization and adhesion (Fn1, Lamb2, Itga1, Olfml2a, Sbspon, Sned1), sphingolipid metabolism (Acer2, Degs2), and arterial-specific signaling molecules (Bmx, P2ry1, Edn1). The arterial-enriched transcription factor Pparg appears prominently. Matrix metalloproteinase regulation (Reck) and calcium signaling (Cracr2a, Pitpnm3) further define this program. Cell-type enrichment in large-artery, cycling artery, and distal arteriolar ECs with depletion in venous ECs is strongly supported by arterial-specific genes (Bmx, Pparg, Edn1).\n\n## Functional modules and mechanisms\n\n**Module 1: TGF-\u03b2 signaling and growth factor response**  \nKey genes: Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2, Smad6, Ltbp4, Cav1, Cav2, Pparg, Edn1, Vegfc  \nProposed mechanism: TGF-\u03b2 pathway components (Tgfbr1/2, Smad6) coordinate with caveolar proteins (Cav1, Cav2) to regulate endothelial responsiveness to growth factors. Pparg, which shows high specificity in arterial ECs (PMID:37982169), may modulate this response alongside endothelin signaling (Edn1).\n\n**Module 2: Non-canonical WNT signaling**  \nKey genes: Wnt5b, Fzd4, Ccn4  \nProposed mechanism: Wnt5b signals through Fzd4 receptor (STRING interaction score 957) to activate non-canonical pathways, potentially involving JNK signaling (PMID:41091903). Ccn4, a WNT1-inducible protein, may modulate ECM-cell interactions by binding decorin and biglycan. The repressor role of Fzd4 (log2FC=+0.179) suggests negative feedback regulation.\n\n**Module 3: ECM organization and cell-substrate adhesion**  \nKey genes: Fn1, Lamb2, Itga1, Reck, Olfml2a, Sbspon, Sned1, Vcam1, Fermt3  \nProposed mechanism: Fibronectin (Fn1) and laminin (Lamb2) provide structural scaffolds recognized by integrin Itga1, while Reck suppresses matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity to stabilize ECM. Olfml2a and Sbspon contribute to ECM structural organization. This module supports the focal adhesion enrichment (Cav1, Cav2, Fn1, Lamb2, Itga1).\n\n**Module 4: Sphingolipid metabolism**  \nKey genes: Acer2, Degs2, Spaar  \nProposed mechanism: Acer2 hydrolyzes very long-chain ceramides to generate sphingosine, shifting the balance from pro-proliferative sphingosine-1-phosphate toward pro-apoptotic sphingosine. Degs2 acts as a bifunctional enzyme in phytosphingolipid biosynthesis. This metabolic program may regulate endothelial proliferation and barrier function.\n\n**Module 5: Arterial-specific signaling and calcium handling**  \nKey genes: Bmx, P2ry1, Cracr2a, Pitpnm3, Emp2  \nProposed mechanism: The arterial-enriched tyrosine kinase Bmx regulates endothelial activation including VCAM-1 expression (PMID:35611166). P2ry1 responds to extracellular ATP/ADP with calcium mobilization through phospholipase C. Cracr2a activates store-operated calcium channels, while Pitpnm3 provides phosphatidylinositol transfer activity. Emp2 modulates caveolin-1 and integrin function in plasma membranes.\n\n## Distinctive features\n\nThe arterial specificity is particularly distinctive, with convergent evidence from Bmx (arterial tyrosine kinase), Pparg (arterial EC-specific transcription factor), and depletion in venous populations. The co-occurrence of sphingolipid metabolism enzymes (Acer2, Degs2) with TGF-\u03b2 responsiveness is unusual and may reflect arterial-specific metabolic requirements for wall stress and shear force adaptation. The presence of Reck as an MMP-9 inhibitor alongside extensive ECM genes suggests active ECM stabilization rather than remodeling.\n\n## Regulator analysis\n\n**Tgfbr1** (activator, log2FC=-0.024): [Confidence: High]  \nMechanistic hypothesis: Tgfbr1 knockdown reduces program activity, indicating this receptor directly activates the TGF-\u03b2 response module. Strong STRING interactions with Tgfbr2, Smad6, and downstream targets (Cav1, Fn1, Fbn1, Pparg) support a model where TGF-\u03b2 signaling coordinates ECM production, caveolar organization, and arterial transcription factor expression. The interaction with Pparg (score 623) suggests TGF-\u03b2 may regulate arterial identity through metabolic transcription factors.\n\n**Fzd4** (repressor, log2FC=+0.179): [Confidence: Medium]  \nMechanistic hypothesis: Fzd4 knockdown increases program activity despite being a receptor for Wnt5b (STRING score 957), suggesting negative feedback where Fzd4 dampens excessive WNT signaling. This may involve \u03b2-catenin-independent pathways that counterbalance the non-canonical Wnt5b-JNK axis. The interaction with Cldn5 (score 486) suggests junction regulation as a mechanism.\n\n## Program stats\n\n**Top-loading genes:** A230057D06Rik, A330076H08Rik, Wnt5b, Spaar, Susd4, Hrct1, Acer2, Reck, Sbspon, Ccn4, Gm609, Bmx, Lmo7, Pitpnm3, Fhl1, P2ry1, Degs2, Itprid2, Emp2, Olfml2a\n\n**Unique genes:** Acsm3, Khdrbs3, Gm44866, Sntg2, Mannr, Cracr2a, Slc2a12, Pparg, Slc35f1, Tox2\n\n**Cell-type enrichment:** Highly specific to large-artery ECs, moderately enriched in cycling artery and distal arteriolar populations, depleted in venous ECs.", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4415, "output_tokens": 1833, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
